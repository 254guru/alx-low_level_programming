# file descriptors


In computer programming, a file descriptor is an abstract representation of a file or other input/output resource. It is an integer value that uniquely identifies an open file or input/output stream within a process.

File descriptors are commonly used in operating systems, particularly in Unix-based systems such as Linux and macOS, to provide a way for processes to interact with files and other input/output resources. When a process opens a file or creates a new one, the operating system assigns a file descriptor to the file, which the process can then use to read from, write to, or manipulate the file in other ways.

File descriptors are usually represented as non-negative integers, and the operating system maintains a table of file descriptors for each process. This table maps each file descriptor to an underlying file or other input/output resource.

In Unix-based systems, there are three standard file descriptors that are automatically opened for each process: STDIN (file descriptor 0), STDOUT (file descriptor 1), and STDERR (file descriptor 2). These file descriptors correspond to the standard input, standard output, and standard error streams, respectively.

Programmers can use various system calls, such as `open()`, `close()`, `read()`, and `write()`, to manipulate file descriptors and perform input/output operations on files or other resources.
