# Bit Manipulation
Bit manipulation is the process of manipulating individual bits or groups of bits within a binary number. It is a fundamental concept in computer science and is used in a wide variety of applications, such as cryptography, computer graphics, and network protocols.

In programming, bit manipulation is commonly used to optimize algorithms and data structures, as well as to perform low-level operations such as encoding and decoding of data. Bit manipulation can be done using bitwise operators such as AND, OR, XOR, and NOT, as well as shift operators such as left shift and right shift.
