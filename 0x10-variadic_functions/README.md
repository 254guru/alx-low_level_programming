c variadic functions.
Variadic functions are functions in programming that can accept a variable number of arguments. This means that they can take in an indefinite number of arguments, allowing for greater flexibility and versatility in the function's use.

variadic functions are typically defined using ellipses (...) in the function parameter list. The ellipses indicate that the function can accept any number of arguments of any type. The arguments are then typically accessed within the function using a special mechanism provided by the programming language, such as the va_list macro in C.
