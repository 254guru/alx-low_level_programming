# Search Algorithms

Search Algorithms are a set of implementations designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored.

## Categories of search Algorithms
<li>
<strong>Sequential search</strong>: <p> In this, the list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked.</p><em>example: Linear search</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Interval Search:</strong> <p> These algorithms are specifically designed for searching in sorted data-structures. These type of searching algorithms are much more efficient than Linear Search as they repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half.</p><em>example: Binary Search</em>
</li>
