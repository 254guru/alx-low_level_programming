# Search Algorithms

Search Algorithms are a set of implementations designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored.

## Categories of search Algorithms
<li>
<strong>Sequential search</strong>: <p> In this, the list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked.</p><em>example: Linear search</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Interval Search:</strong> <p> These algorithms are specifically designed for searching in sorted data-structures. These type of searching algorithms are much more efficient than Linear Search as they repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half.</p><em>example: Binary Search</em>
</li>

## Space Complexity
<p>Auxiliary Space is the extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm.
The space Complexity of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input. </p><p><em>Space complexity is a parallel concept to time complexity. </em></p>
